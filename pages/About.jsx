          Nice to meet you - and thanks for checking out my website! I&apos;m a
          student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and
          Business Administration at Wilfrid Laurier University. I&apos;m
          passionate about using digital tools to build fun projects and solve
          tricky problems.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The langauges I&apos;m most familiar with are Java and C, but
          I&apos;ve also worked on projects with Python, SQL, HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript and Racket. In terms of tools/frameworks, I&apos;ve worked
          with React, NextJS, Node.js, Selenium, and Google Workspace/MS Office
          (of course). I like to create any graphics I need using a variety of
          fun tools, but primarily using MediBang and Asesprite.
