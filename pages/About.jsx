        Nice to meet you! I&apos;m a second-year student studying Computer
        Science at the University of Waterloo and Business Administration at
        Wilfrid Laurier University. Originally, I&apos;d planned to go to art
        school, but I ended up here somehow...
        <br />
        <br />
        The langauges I&apos;m most familiar with are Java and C, but I&apos;ve
        also worked with Python, Racket, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Other
        langauges include English, Mandarin Chinese and French). In terms of
        tools, I&apos;ve worked with a couple! React, Node.js, Google
        Workspace/MS Office, MediBang, Asesprite, etc.
        <br />
        <br />I hope to briefly summarize what I&apos;m about and show you some
        of the projects I&apos;ve been working on via this website!
